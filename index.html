Hello! My name is Nitin, welcome to my blog! I am primarily using this blog as a way to teach myself new things, primarily in the field of Data Science, Programming, Statistics, and Optimization. I believe that the key to understanding a concept well is to teach it to someone else. Using [fastpages](https://fastpages.fast.ai/) I am finding it really easy to maintain a blog while I continue learning understand new concepts using [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks. Most of the posts on here are Work in Progress, most completed posts are tagged. If you would like to get in touch, you can find me on the social platforms below.
