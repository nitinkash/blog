Hello! Welcome to my blog! I am a Freelance Consultant who helps people and companies solve problems using data science and analytics. My projects include automating boring error-prone jobs, wrangling data and creating insights, and building models to improve decision making.

I decided to start this blog after taking a few classes of the [fastai](https://fast.ai) MOOC. I am primarily looking to maintain this blog to document concepts I progress along the course. I got introduced to Neural Networks as a part of Heuristics course at Texas A&M. While I have worked with Machine Learning Models in the past, I had found Neural Networks and Deep Learning very intimidating. I have signed up for several courses on Coursera on Neural Networks and Deep Learning only to quit a few weeks later when the math starts getting too hard. Earlier in 2021, I came across fastai and got interested in their code first approach to learning Deep Learning. I got into the course and spent a couple of days fiddling around with the jupyter notebooks. But again, after a couple of videos, I found myself slacking off again. In the first course video, [Jeremy Howard](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward?lang=en) emphasized the importance of maintaining a blog. After reading this [post](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045) by [Rachel Thomas](https://twitter.com/math_rachel?lang=en) I decided to start this blog to explain difficult concepts to myself and to also stay motivated during the course. Eventually, I intend to create some cool applications of Deep Learning and add them here.
