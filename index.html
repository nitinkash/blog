Hello! My name is Nitin Kashyap and Welcome to my blog, where I talk about my journey into the world of Deep Learning. I am primarily a Freelance Consultant who helps people and companies solve problems using data science and analytics. My projects include automating boring error-prone jobs, wrangling data and creating insights, and building models to improve decision making.

I decided to start this blog after taking a few classes of the **[fastai](https://fast.ai)]** MOOC. I am primarily looking to maintain this blog to document concepts I progress along the course. I got introduced to Neural Networks as a part of Heuristics course at Texas A&M. While I had experience in building Machine Learning Models, I found Neural Networks and Deep Learning very intimidating. I have singed up for several courses on Coursera on Neural Networks and Deep Learning only to quit a few weeks later when the course got too hard. I came across fastai and recently read about the **[Universal Approximation Theorem](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10472-020-09723-1)** which basically implies that any continuous function can be approximated using Deep Learning. I got curious and decided to explore Deep Learning once again through fastai's course. After reading Rachel Thomas' **[post](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045)** I realised the the best way for me to master these difficult concepts and stay motivated to finish this course is to maintain this blog. I intend to create some cool applications of Deep Learning and add them here.
