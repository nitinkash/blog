I decided to start this blog after taking a few classes of the **[fastai](https://fast.ai)** MOOC. I am primarily looking to maintain this blog to document concepts I progress along the course. I got introduced to Neural Networks as a part of Heuristics course at Texas A&M. While I had experience in building Machine Learning Models, I found Neural Networks and Deep Learning very intimidating. I have signed up for several courses on Coursera on Neural Networks and Deep Learning only to quit a few weeks later when the course got too hard. I came across fastai and recently read about the **[Universal Approximation Theorem](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10472-020-09723-1)** which basically implies that any continuous function can be approximated using Deep Learning. I got curious and decided to explore Deep Learning once again through fastai's course. After reading Rachel Thomas' **[post](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045)** I decided to start this blog to explain these difficult concepts to myself and also stay motivated and finish the course. After that I intend to create some cool applications of Deep Learning and add them here.
