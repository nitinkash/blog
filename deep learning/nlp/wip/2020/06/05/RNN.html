<h3 id="Objective:">Objective:<a class="anchor-link" href="#Objective:"> </a></h3><p>Traditional Neural networks found it very difficult to execute tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP). To understand a sentence it is important to both understand each word, it's relationship with the previous and successive words and also the context in which the word is being used. Recurrent Neural Networks adopt a structure that helps solve this issue and is the main focus of this article. I will then explore approaches and try to build a text generator</p>

<h3 id="Language-Model:">Language Model:<a class="anchor-link" href="#Language-Model:"> </a></h3><p>Language Modelling is a central task in Natural Language Processing and is at the heart of many systems like speech recognition, machine translation and text generation. Given the words $ x_{1},..., x_{t}$ the language model predicts the following probability</p>
$$
 P(x_{t+1} = v_{j} | x_{t}, ... x_{1})
$$<p>where $v_{j}$ is every word in the vocabulary. Here I will be building a Language Model using Recurrent Neural Networks.</p>

<h3 id="What-is-a-Recurrent-Neural-Network?">What is a Recurrent Neural Network?<a class="anchor-link" href="#What-is-a-Recurrent-Neural-Network?"> </a></h3><p>A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a type of Neural Network that allows previous outputs to be used as inputs while using hidden states. It is called a Recurrent Network because it repeatedly takes an input, uses it to modify a hidden layer and then provides an output which is then fed back to the hidden layer along with the next input. The hidden layer acts as "memory" that keeps track of the previous inputs by how the weights in the layer were modified by the said input. Consider an example of a RNN working on predicting the next word in a sentence. The first word is passed into a hidden layer, the output of this hidden layer is then passed on to the next hidden layer along with the second word. This process continues till all the inputs are passed on to the final output layer which predicts the final word. In this way, the RNN has an "understanding" of each word in the network and can make a reasonable prediction of the final word.</p>
<p><code># TODO: Add image of RNN for predicting the next word here::</code></p>
<p>The structure used here is a many-to-one type of RNN. Many other RNN architectures have been developed to accomplish other tasks like music generation, sentiment analysis and machine translation.</p>

<h3 id="Long-Short-Term-Memory-(LSTM):">Long Short Term Memory (LSTM):<a class="anchor-link" href="#Long-Short-Term-Memory-(LSTM):"> </a></h3><p>One of the main drawbacks in using RNNs is that of Vanishing or Exploding Gradients. This is what While training the data with so many layers will result in gradients of the layers to explore to a very large number or diminsh to a number close to 0. This problem was exacerbated as the length of the input sequence increased and were not very useful in making predictions as the sentences got very long.</p>
<p>To avoid this a special type iof RNN using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) units  were developed. When we say LSTM NEtwork, we mean a neural network which contains an LSTM recurrent layer. LSTM cells were first introduced in 1997 in a paper by Sepp Hochreiter and Jürgen Schmidhuber. In the paper, the authors describe how LSTMs do not suffer from the same vanishing gradient problem experienced by RNNs and can be trained on sequences that are hundreds of timesteps long. Since then, the LSTM architecture has been adapted and improved, and variations such as gated recurrent units (GRUs) are now widely utilized and available as layers in Keras.</p>
<p>Let's build a simple LSTM network in Keras here:</p>

<h4 id="Tokenization">Tokenization<a class="anchor-link" href="#Tokenization"> </a></h4><p>The first step to handling text data is to tokenize the text, Tokenization is the process of splitting the text into individual parts like words or characters. First we get the text we would like to tokenize, I am choosing to use The Strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by R.L Stevenson, one of my favourite books form middle school. I am going to use the text from Project Gutenberg's page</p>

Otherwise it\&#39;s not silent, now is it?\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Non-religious reasons for having a &#34;moment of silence&#34; for a dead\n&gt;&gt;&gt;classmate: (1) to comfort the friends by showing respect to the\n&gt;&gt;&gt;deceased , (2) to give the classmates a moment to grieve together, (3)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;to give the friends a moment to remember their classmate *in the\n&gt;&gt;&gt;context of the school*, (4) to deal with the fact that the classmate\n&gt;&gt;&gt;is gone so that it\&#39;s not disruptive later.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Yeah, all well and good. The fact is, though, that the pro-school\n&gt;&gt;prayer types have tried to use a moment of silence as a way\n&gt;&gt;to get prayer back. At my high school for instance, our dear\n&gt;&gt;principal ended the moment of silence with &#34;Amen.&#34;\n&gt;I can certainly see opposing the &#34;Amen&#34; -- but that doesn\&#39;t require \n&gt;opposing a moment of silence.\nI see it as the camel\&#39;s nose.\n\n&gt;&gt;I\&#39;ll back off when they do.\n&gt;Does anybody else besides me see a vicious circle here?  I guarantee\n&gt;you the people who want school prayer aren\&#39;t going to back off when\n&gt;they can\&#39;t even manage to get a quiet moment for their kids to pray\n&gt;silently.\nI\&#39;m willing to take my chances on winning the whole thing, personally.\n-Ekr\n\n\n-- \nEric Rescorla                                     ekr@eitech.com\n        &#34;What we\&#39;ve got here is failure to communicate.&#34;\n        \n&#39;</pre>
