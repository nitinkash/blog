Why? Why start a blog now?

Right now it's May 2021, I am in India while the whole country is battling the second wave of COVID-19 infections. Every day gets more depressing than the last, bringing news of new cases and deaths to someone I know. It's a really depressing environment and being locked up at home makes it so much worse. Watching COVID-19 rip up families and destroy the livelihood of nearly every other person was incredibly painful to watch. As news unfolded of even crematoriums being so over-worked that their steel chimneys were started to melt I got a sense of how bad the damage was. 

With death being such a real possibility, I started to think about how I had lived my life and if it was my last day was to come in the near future how would I live these potential last few days. Would I want to spend them sitting around at home moping on about how helpless I felt? This was pretty much the same question that Steve Jobs contemplated upon and referred to in his [Stanford commencement address](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc). After rewatching that for the umpteenth time I decided to think about how I was spending my life and what regrets I would have if today was my last day. 

### My top regrets:
- So the first thing that came to my mind was that I was not going to be able to visit all the places I wanted to. I still wanted to see, experience and accomplish so many things like going on a summit expedition, climbing my To-Do routes, Freediving, seeing Mt Everest, etc. Thinking of these made me feel privileged and the virtue-signalling part of me told me to stop. Also, these were impossible to do right now from home and all I could do to be in the best shape to do this was to stay healthy and workout from home.
- So I narrowed my options into what would I regret not doing if I was indoors. If I was forced to stay locked down at home and if today was my last day, what would I do? The first thing that came to mind was to finish the fastai course I had started a few weeks back. I was looking to learn about building Neural Networks and Deep Learning and try to build applications that would supplement my life as a derivatives trader. If I were to die soon, then I would probably do what I love, which was to build cool things with computers. In some crazy way this was a great time to learn a new skill. 

Which brings me to this blog. How do I teach myself something like Deep Learning where there is no one to teach and give me feedback. I came across a solution from this [article](https://blog.doist.com/feynman-technique/) about the Feynman Method. Basically, with this blog I intend to explain difficult concepts to myself and to also stay motivated during the course. You will probably find the things explained here, explained better elsewhere. For now, I am going to focus on the following.
- the Deep learning course of [fast.ai](fast.ai)

I will update this list the longer I stay alive. Let's stop moping and get started
