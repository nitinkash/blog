            "title": "Basic Concepts Overview",
            "content": ". While working on Kaggle Competetions, I realised that I had lost touch with the fundamentals of Neural Networks and though it was a good idea to go over these concepts again. While it is possible today to build models and make predictions without knowing all the details. Working with prediction models in a prefessional setting, I would personally like to know what I am doing so that I avoid potential pitfalls later. . Backpropagation from scratch . Backpropagation is a an algorithm introduced by David Rumelhart, Geoffrey Hinton, and Ronald Williams in this famous paper. The algorithm works much faster than earlier approaches to calculate the gradients of the cost function and essentailly making neural networks solve problems that were previously considered unsolvable. . The algorithm calculates the partial derivative of the Cost function with respect to each and every weight and bias in the neural network. This is very valuable as this gives us an intuitive and natural interpretation for each element in the network. I will now be going into the math behind the Backpropogation. . Notation: . The four fundamental equations behind Backpropagation: . Backpropgation is essentally a method to understand how changing the weights and biases in the neural network affects the cost function. Mathematically, we want to calculate $ frac{ partial C}{ partial w_{jk}^{l}}$ and $ frac{ partial C}{ partial b_{j}^{l}}$. Before we compute these we introduce an error term $ delta_{j}^{l}$ which represents the error in the $j^{th}$ neuron of the $l^{th}$ layer. . The First Equation . The error term is calculated using the equation $$ delta_{j}^{l} = frac{ partial C}{ partial a_{j}^{L}} sigma&#39;(z_{j}^{L}) $$ . This equation is a very intuitive result. The $ partial C/ partial {a_{j}^{L}}$ term measures how fast the Cost function is changing with respect to the activations of the $j^{th}$ output activation. If the Cost Function does not depend on the output of a particular neuron $j$, then the term $ delta_{j}^{L} $ will be very small, which is as expected. The second term $ sigma&#39;(z_{j}^{L}) $ measures how fast the activation function $ sigma$ is changing at $z_{j}^{L}$ . Everything in this equation of $ delta _{j}^{L}$ can be computed fairly easily. The exact form of $ partial C/ partial {a_{j}^{L}}$ will depend on the nature of the cost function used. If we use a quadratic cost function of the form $ C = frac{1}{2} Sigma_{j} (y_{j} - a_{j}^{L}) $ then the value of $ partial C/ partial {a_{j}^{L}} = (a_{j}^{L} - y_{j})$ which can be computed easily. . To avoid the index nightmare we can alse represent this as in matrix notation as $$ delta^L = nabla_{a} C odot sigma&#39;(z^L) $$. Here, $ nabla_{a} C$ is basically a vector whose components are $ partial C/ partial {a_{j}^{L}}$, the rate of change of $C$ with respect to the output activations. For a quadratic loss function $ nabla_a C =(a^L-y)$ so the previous equation reduces to $$ delta^L = (a^L-y) odot sigma&#39;(z^L). $$ . Every component in this equation has a vector form that can be calculated easily using Numpy which is the goal of this exercise. . The Second Equation: . The second equation of importance is used to calculate the error term $ delta_l$ with the error in the next layer $ delta_{l+1}$ . $$ delta^l = ((w^{l+1})^T delta^{l+1}) odot sigma&#39;(z^l) $$where $w^{l+1} $ is the weight matrix for the $(l+1)^{th} $ layer. This equation seems complicated, but each element has a nice interpretation. Suppose we know the error $ delta_{l+1}$ at the $l+1^{th}$ layer. When we apply the transpose weight matrix, $(w_{l+1})^T$, we can think intuitively of this as moving the error backward through the network. This gives us a measure of the error at the output of the $l^{th}$ layer. We can then take the Hadamard product $ odot sigma′(z^l)$ to calculate the the error $ delta_l$ in the weighted input to layer $l$. . By combining the forst and second equations, we can compute the error $ delta_l$ for any layer in the network. We start by using the first equation to compute $ delta_L$ and then apply the second equation to compute $ delta_{l-1}$, $ delta_{l-2}$, and so on, all the way to the start of the network. . The Third equation: . This equation is related to the rate of cahnge of the Cost function with respect to any bias term in the network. $$ frac{ partial C}{ partial b^l_j} = delta^l_j $$ . This makes the calculation convenient as we already have methods to calculate the $ delta_{j}^{l} $ using the first two equations. We can represent this as shorthand by removing the indices after understanding that $ delta$ is being evaluated at the same neuron as bias $b$. . The Fourth Equation: . This equation fills in the missing piece by providing an expression to calculate the rate of change of the costfunction with respect to any weight in the network. . $$ frac{ partial C}{ partial w^l_{jk}} = a^{l-1}_k delta^l_j $$ . This may seem complicated again but when we look at it in terms of a less index heavy representation we can see that it basically states that the rate of change of the Cost function because of the weights is the product of the activation of the neuron input with the error of the neuron output from the weight $w$. $$ frac{ partial C}{ partial w} = a_{ rm in} delta_{ rm out} $$ . A consequence of this equatioon is that the gradtent term $ partial C / partial w $ will be small if the activation $a_{in} approx 0$. This means that low-activation neurons will learn slowly as it does not change much during Gradient descent. . Another insight from these equations is related to the nature of the activation function. If we use a Sigmoid function($ sigma(z) = {1}/(1+e^{-z})$) as our activation function, we run into the issue of the output layer learning slowly. This happens because the valie of the $ sigma$ function becomes flat when it comes close to 0 or 1 and the the gradient of the activation function will tend to 0. The key takeaway from this is that the output layer of a will learn slowly if the output neuron is either low or high activation. We say here that the output neuron has saturated. . We can also extend this to previous layers using the second equation. If a particular neuron is close to saturation then the weights input of that neuron will also learn slowly. To overcome this we can design other activation functions which have properties that are useful in our applications. . Activation Functions . To overcome various issues with the Sigmoid activation function, other activation functions have been developed. I will go over some commonly used activation functions in this section: . SoftMax . The softmax function is commonly used in multi-calss classification as this provides a framework to calculate probabilities of each target calss over all possible target classes. It is defined as $$ softmax(x_i) = frac{e^{x_i}}{ Sigma_j e^{x_j}}$$ . The main advantage of this activation function is that the output ranges from 0 to 1 and the sum of probabilities will also sum up to 1. The implementation in numpy is quite straightforward as shown below: . import numpy as np from tensorflow.nn import softmax as tf_softmax def softmax(input): return np.exp(input) / float(sum(np.exp(input))) input = np.random.rand(3) . print(tf_softmax(input)) print(softmax(input)) . tf.Tensor([0.38086243 0.17050068 0.44863688], shape=(3,), dtype=float64) [0.38086243 0.17050068 0.44863688] . tanh . The Backpropogartion Algorithm . The backpropagation equations provide us with a way of computing the gradient of the cost function. Let&#39;s explicitly write this out in the form of an algorithm: . Input $x$: Set the corresponding activation $a_1$ for the input layer. | Feedforward: For each $l=1, 2 ,3 , … ,L$ compute $z^{l} = w^l a^{l-1}+b^l$ and $a^{l} = sigma(z^{l})$ | Output error $ delta_l$: Compute the vector $ delta^{L} = nabla_a C odot sigma&#39;(z^L)$ | Backpropagate the error: Compute the errors for each of the laters using $ delta^{l} = ((w^{l+1})^T delta^{l+1}) odot sigma&#39;(z^{l})$ | Output: The gradient of the cost function is given by $ frac{ partial C}{ partial w^l_{jk}} = a^{l-1}_k delta^l_j$ and $ frac{ partial C}{ partial b^l_j} = delta^l_j $ | The backpropagation algorithm gives us a way of calculating the derivative of the cost function with respect ot each of the weights and biases in the network. Practically, this algorithm is used along with stochastic gradient descent while calculating the gradient for many training examples. We also split up the training examples into mini-batches and then apply a gradient descent learning step based on every mini batch. . import torch . .",

            "content": "Objective: . I wanted to get into the habit of seriously taking part in some Kaggle competetions. The Tabluar Playground Series seemed like a good place to start.

It appears that the data is very sparse and fortunately contains no null values. We will need to do some dimensiontionality reduction (PCA) and pick the best features to reduce the noise in the input dataset. . train[&#39;target&#39;].hist() . &lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7fc5009f2c90&gt; . Looks like Class_2 has a lot more data points than the other 3 classes combined. This is a pretty skewed datset and will bias the classifier, I am thinking of using SMOTE to handle the issue of class imbalance in the dataset. . (train == 0).sum().sum()/(train.shape[0]*train.shape[1])*100 . 76.35163461538461 . Another thing I noticed was that 75 % of the data values are 0s, so the dataset is very sparse. Lets get started and build a small simple model. Firstly we will clean up the datasets and create the variables necessary to start on building the model. . train.target = pd.Categorical(train.target) train[&#39;target2&#39;] = train.target.cat.codes from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split indep_vars = [&#39;feature_&#39; + str(i) for i in range(50)] dep_var = [&#39;target2&#39;] X = train[indep_vars].to_numpy() y = train[dep_var].to_numpy().ravel() X_train, X_valid, y_train, y_valid = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42) X_test = test[indep_vars].to_numpy() . Naive Baseline Model - Random Forest . Here we are building a simple model using a RandomForest classifier. The main purpose of this is to get a baseline perfromance and also identify key features that can be used for later analyses. . X_train, X_valid, y_train, y_valid = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42) . from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_jobs=-1, n_estimators=40, max_samples=70000, max_features=0.5, min_samples_leaf=5, oob_score=True) rf.fit(X_train, y_train) rf.score(X_valid, y_valid) . 0.5757 . from sklearn.metrics import plot_confusion_matrix plot_confusion_matrix(rf, X_valid, y_valid) . &lt;sklearn.metrics._plot.confusion_matrix.ConfusionMatrixDisplay at 0x7fc4ea6d1e50&gt; . rf.predict_proba(X_test) . array([[0.14013549, 0.5686321 , 0.14980887, 0.14142354], [0.0913934 , 0.68614493, 0.16746077, 0.0550009 ], [0.05243985, 0.61068121, 0.20493451, 0.13194442], ..., [0.09103053, 0.54871624, 0.20957293, 0.1506803 ], [0.04416667, 0.65122176, 0.15509768, 0.14951389], [0.13996562, 0.51813905, 0.23093735, 0.11095798]]) . As expected the model does not perform very well and most of the classes are mis-classified in favour of the majority class here. Let&#39;s see how well this did on Kaggle . . SMOTE: . To deal with the class imbalance issue, I decide to try out SMOTE and see if the helps in the prediction. . from imblearn.over_sampling import KMeansSMOTE ros = KMeansSMOTE(random_state=0) X_resampled, y_resampled = ros.fit_resample(X, y) X_train, X_valid, y_train, y_valid = train_test_split(X_resampled, y_resampled, test_size=0.3, random_state=42) rf_SMOTE = RandomForestClassifier(n_jobs=-1, n_estimators=40, max_samples=70000, max_features=0.5, min_samples_leaf=5, oob_score=True) rf_SMOTE.fit(X_train, y_train) print(rf_SMOTE.score(X_train, y_train)) rf_SMOTE.score(X_valid, y_valid) . from sklearn.metrics import plot_confusion_matrix plot_confusion_matrix(rf_SMOTE, X_valid, y_valid) . submission2 = submissionFile(rf_SMOTE, generate_csv=True) . !kaggle competitions submit -c tabular-playground-series-may-2021 -f submission.csv -m &quot;SMOTE Oversampling - Randomforests&quot; . . Unfortunately SMOTE did not help improve the quality of the predictions. . CatBoost . After trying PCA and SMOTE after tweaking the parameters and getting worse predictions than the simpleRandom Forests mosel. I came across the CatBoost Calssifier from one of the notebooks on Kaggle. . from catboost import Pool, CatBoostClassifier from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold def train_models(df, columns, cat_features, random_state, n_splits): models = [] folds = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=n_splits, shuffle=True, random_state=random_state) # create folds X_train = df[columns] y_train = df[&#39;target&#39;] for n_fold, (train_idx, valid_idx) in enumerate(folds.split(X_train, y_train)): print(&#39;Fold {}/{}&#39;.format(n_fold, n_splits)) train_X, train_y = X_train.iloc[train_idx], y_train.iloc[train_idx] valid_X, valid_y = X_train.iloc[valid_idx], y_train.iloc[valid_idx] dataset = Pool(train_X, train_y, cat_features) evalset = Pool(valid_X, valid_y, cat_features) model = CatBoostClassifier( task_type=&quot;GPU&quot;, depth=4, max_ctr_complexity=15, # border_count=1024, iterations=50000, od_wait=1000, od_type=&#39;Iter&#39;, # l2_leaf_reg=0.01, learning_rate=0.01, min_data_in_leaf=1, use_best_model=True, loss_function=&#39;MultiClass&#39; ) model.fit(dataset, plot=False, verbose=500, eval_set=evalset) _record = { &#39;model&#39;: model, } models.append(_record) return models . models = train_models(df=train, columns=indep_vars, cat_features=indep_vars, random_state=43, n_splits=9) .

            "content": "Embeddings: . A new way for search using Neural Networks. . Similar question retreival: Identify questions most closely related with the input question. This porblem deals with ranking the set of available questions with one specific questions using a similarity metric. Google has a huge database of questions and would like to solve the user&#39;s new question even if it is paraphrased differently. This is a problem of a much broader problem of search. When presented with a query, a search engine would like to search and find various entities like images, videos, documents, and even relavent ads. What is the best way to retreive these items? . Retreival problems have been traditionally solved using an inverted-index since the 90&#39;s. An inverted index is basically a map between various words and where they are located. When the user queries a specific word, the system returns all the instances where that word was located. There are a bunch of subtle improvements like using Stemming or Regular Expressions to enhance the search functioanality but the overall idea has been to use an inverted-index to retrieve the candidates. The main issues with this method is that it is limited by word overlap, having a large number of search candidates containing the query makes it difficult for the user to find the exact result. Another issue is of finding other modalities like Images, Videos etc. This can be done by adding annotations etc but still the perfromance is still pretty bad as many items can be missed and annotations is a lengthy an d cumbersome process. . Continuous Retreival: . Here we are focusing on developing a model that ia able to learn to represent objects as vectors in a space that contains all objects. The model will also be able to learn to place similar objects close together (Eggs will be close to cooking eggs, pictures of eggs, of cooking but far away from something like dog or tiger). Another requirement of the model is for a way to be able to retrieve neighbouring objects fast so that the user may find the &quot;best page&quot; faster along with images, how-to videos and other relavent objects. These three cases are the most important requirements to develop a continuous retrieval system. . Outline of the Objects: . Learn to represent objects and continuous vectors. | Learn to place similar objects close together | Learn to retrieve neighbouring object sfast. | Effects of neural retrieval | . Learn to represent objects and continuous vectors. . Language Model: Can we predict the next word given a sequence of words. . Using a one-hot Vector . One way to solve this porblem is to use one-hot encoding to create a vector as long as the vocubulary and then each word will have a 1 for the index representing that particular word and have 0s in all the other positions. We would then use some classification clgortihm like Logistic Regression or Random FOrests to identify which word in the vocabulary would be the best for for the next word in the sequence. . Using Embeddings: . Another way to solve this porblem is not to use one hot encoding but to embed the words to an embedding space with arbitrary weights. We would then use back-propogartion to calculate these weights in the training phase where the model learns about various words and embeds each word in the new embedding space. The embedding space can be of varying dimensions depending on the size and nature of the problem at hand. . Exploring these embeddings will give us insights on how the model is learning and will also give us an opportunity to examine ans solve a lot more broader problems. . Word Embedding Space:We can see simiar words being places close to each other Providing an opportunity to explore relationships. France -&gt; Paris means Italy -&gt; __ . We can see if we can get Rome as a result by looking for results along the same vector line connecting France and Paris. This . Learn to place similar objects close together . The history of NLP involves training models from small labelled datasets.

            "content": "A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a type of Neural Network that allows previous outputs to be used as inputs while using hidden states. It is called a Recurrent Network because it repeatedly takes an input, uses it to modify a hidden layer and then provides an output which is then fed back to the hidden layer along with the next input. The hidden layer acts as “memory” that keeps track of the previous inputs by how the weights in the layer were modified by the said input. Consider an example of a RNN working on predicting the next word in a sentence. The first word is passed into a hidden layer, the output of this hidden layer along with the next input is then passed on to the next hidden layer and this process continues till all the inputs are passed on to the final output layer which predicts the final word. In this way, the RNN has an “understanding” of each word in the network and can make a reasonable prediction of the final word. . TODO: Add image of RNN for predicting the next word here:: . The structure used here is a many-to-one type of RNN. Many other RNN architectures have been developed to accomplish other tasks like music generation, sentiment analysis and machine translation. .",

            "title": "Building a Handwritten Digit Classifier",
            "content": "The Objective: . In one of the lessons in the fastAi MOOC, we built a hand written digit classifier from scratch. We had used the MNIST dataset that contains 70,000 28x28 images of handwritten digits. In this post, I am attempting to expand on that and build a Handwritten digit recognizer to read in a 10 digit phone number with my sloppy handwriting using the same MNIST dataset for training. I am seeing this as a sort of &quot;Hello World&quot; problem as I get into the topics covered in the first few parts of the course. . Lets start by importing the libraries we need: . from fastai.vision.all import * from fastbook import * matplotlib.rc(&#39;image&#39;, cmap=&#39;Greys&#39;) . I had some issues importing the libraries using Colab on Google Chrome. If you run into the same issues, you might need to explicitly specify the library as fastai-V2. See this link . Next, let&#39;s download the data. There are some really cool fastai tools for reading in files. untar_data basically takes care of downloading the MNIST data from fastai&#39;s AWS S3(in the URLS.MNIST variable) in to the working directory. It then decompresses this and returns the path to the extracted files. . path = untar_data(URLs.MNIST) Path.BASE_PATH = path . Another nifty little thing fastai has provided is to access the working directory directly on Jupyter books using path.ls() This basically lets you run the ls command in the Jupyter notebook itself and not have to switch back and forth with the terminal. . path.ls() . (#2) [Path(&#39;training&#39;),Path(&#39;testing&#39;)] . The MNIST dataset follows a common layout for machine learning datasets: separate folders for the training set and the validation set (and/or test set). Let&#39;s see what&#39;s inside the testing and training set: . (path/&#39;testing&#39;).ls() . (#10) [Path(&#39;testing/1&#39;),Path(&#39;testing/0&#39;),Path(&#39;testing/5&#39;),Path(&#39;testing/8&#39;),Path(&#39;testing/7&#39;),Path(&#39;testing/3&#39;),Path(&#39;testing/2&#39;),Path(&#39;testing/4&#39;),Path(&#39;testing/9&#39;),Path(&#39;testing/6&#39;)] . (path/&#39;training&#39;).ls() . (#10) [Path(&#39;training/1&#39;),Path(&#39;training/0&#39;),Path(&#39;training/5&#39;),Path(&#39;training/8&#39;),Path(&#39;training/7&#39;),Path(&#39;training/3&#39;),Path(&#39;training/2&#39;),Path(&#39;training/4&#39;),Path(&#39;training/9&#39;),Path(&#39;training/6&#39;)] . As expected, there are separate folders for images of each of the 10 digits. Usually, without having any pre-defined functions to read in the data, we would have to read in the files using something like . ones = (path/&#39;training&#39;/&#39;1&#39;).ls().sorted() twos = (path/&#39;training&#39;/&#39;2&#39;).ls().sorted() threes = (path/&#39;training&#39;/&#39;3&#39;).ls().sorted() fours = (path/&#39;training&#39;/&#39;4&#39;).ls().sorted() fives = (path/&#39;training&#39;/&#39;5&#39;).ls().sorted() sixes = (path/&#39;training&#39;/&#39;6&#39;).ls().sorted() sevens = (path/&#39;training&#39;/&#39;7&#39;).ls().sorted() eights = (path/&#39;training&#39;/&#39;8&#39;).ls().sorted() nines = (path/&#39;training&#39;/&#39;9&#39;).ls().sorted() zeros = (path/&#39;training&#39;/&#39;0&#39;).ls().sorted() . This is cumbersome and might lead to some inadvertent errors while writing the lines of code for each category. Fortunately, fastai also has an inbuilt ImageDataLoaders class that helps us easily import the required files and also automatically assign the labels. . To start creating the model, we need to create the training and validation sets. I am going to create an ImageNet style dataset using the ImageDataLoaders.from_folder method. The idea is to build the model using the training and validation sets and then test it on my handwriting . dls = ImageDataLoaders.from_folder(path=path/&#39;training&#39;, valid_pct=0.2) . print(len(dls.train_ds.items)) print(len(dls.valid_ds.items)) . 48000 12000 . So this has created a validation set with 20% of the 60000 images in the training folder. were Let&#39;s take a look at these images to make sure the ImageDataLoaders method is working as intended . dls.show_batch(nrows=1, ncols=10) . Lets take a look at a single image and get some more information about what we are dealing with here. . img = Image.open(dls.train_ds.items[0]) img . img.shape . .

Building the model using fastai . fatsai has provided a convenient way to train models using very few lines of code. Here we will use cnn_learner to create a Convolutional Neural Network Learner. Here we will be training an 18 layer neural network based on the resnet18 architecture. resnet18 is a pre-trained network that was trained to classify images into various object categories, ranging from a keyboard, mouse, and pencil, to many types of animals. Therefore, this network has learned some rich feature representations for a wide range of images. We will then call the fit_one_cycle method with the number of epochs and the learning rate to train this network with the images loaded in the ImageDataLoaders. . learn_cnn_basic = cnn_learner(dls, resnet18, pretrained=False, metrics=accuracy) learn_cnn_basic.fit_one_cycle(1, 0.1) . epoch train_loss valid_loss accuracy time . 0 | 0.127607 | 0.071589 | 0.979500 | 01:01 | . And within a minute we have a model with over 95% accuracy on the validation set! Let&#39;s see how well it does on my handwriting. . My Handwriting dataset . I created this dataset by writing down a sequence of &quot;random&quot; numbers on a piece of paper. I then took a picture of it with my phone and then uploaded it to the working directory. . Immediately, I figured out an issue, the MNIST model we have just trained looks at digits individually and has no way of separating each digit in the picture (Image Segmentation). Unfortunately it seemed to complex for me to include as a part of this post. I do plan, however, to extend this post to segment the digits from a single image. . So, while I learn Image Segmentation, I used my &quot;Natural Intelligence&quot; and very messily cropped out 10 separate images to test my models. . Here is the full number that I wrote: . HandWrittenNumber = Image.open(&#39;/content/HandWrittenNumber.jpg&#39;) #Saving each number into a list below: actual = [&#39;9&#39;,&#39;7&#39;,&#39;8&#39;,&#39;5&#39;,&#39;3&#39;,&#39;8&#39;,&#39;7&#39;,&#39;6&#39;,&#39;9&#39;,&#39;0&#39;] HandWrittenNumber . Lets load the images into a list called digits. We wll need to transform these images to make them similar to the imput image above. . Now let&#39;s make sure the data in the training and validation sets are similar before we convert all the images . show_image(tensor(Image.open(dls.train_ds.items[0]))) print(tensor(Image.open(dls.train_ds.items[0])).shape) print(tensor(Image.open(dls.train_ds.items[0])).ndim) . torch.Size([28, 28]) 2 . print([digit.shape for digit in digits]) show_image(digits[0]) . [(498, 423), (518, 415), (484, 395), (451, 481), (466, 439), (569, 453), (552, 405), (499, 411), (511, 381), (639, 459)] . &lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7f35a5107550&gt; . . As expected, the test images all have different sizes, this needs to be fixed by resizing. . digits[0].resize((28,28)) . Applying that for all the other images . resized = [l.resize((28,28)) for l in digits] test_tensors = [255 - tensor(l2) for l2 in resized] . show_image(test_tensors[0]) . &lt;matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7f3569d98e10&gt; . Image.open(dls.train_ds.items[0]) . Apart from the poor contrast the image looks quite similar to the one we have in MNIST. Let&#39;s see if the model is able to predict this. . prediction_results basically prints out the prediction and the % of correct predictions in a neat format. Unhide the cell below to see more details. . def prediction_results(lea_rn): number_predict = [] for i in range(len(test_tensors)): pred,pred_idx,probs = lea_rn.predict(test_tensors[i]) number_predict.append(pred) print(f&quot;Actuals: {actual}&quot;) print(f&quot;Predicted number: {number_predict}&quot;) pct = 0 for i in range(10): if actual[i] == number_predict[i]: pct += 1 print(f&quot;Hit Rate: {pct*10} %&quot;) . . prediction_results(learn_cnn_basic) . Actuals: [&#39;9&#39;, &#39;7&#39;, &#39;8&#39;, &#39;5&#39;, &#39;3&#39;, &#39;8&#39;, &#39;7&#39;, &#39;6&#39;, &#39;9&#39;, &#39;0&#39;] Predicted number: [&#39;9&#39;, &#39;8&#39;, &#39;8&#39;, &#39;8&#39;, &#39;8&#39;, &#39;8&#39;, &#39;8&#39;, &#39;8&#39;, &#39;8&#39;, &#39;9&#39;] Hit Rate: 30 % . As expected, the model did not perform very well. It only got 3 out of 10 numbers right. It was basically predicting only 8s and 9s for all the numbers. I can think of these ways to improve this model: . Improve the quality of the input images | Use the right learning rates using the learning rate finder lr_find based on Leslie Smith&#39;s paper. | Use a pre-trained model and just change the weights of the last few layers | Use a Deeper Architecture with more layers. | . Augmenting the Images . One way of dealing with the problem of centring is to fix each of my test images so that the numbers are in the centre of the image. The other easier approach is to train the model by augmenting the training images using RandomResizedCrop . dblock_MNIST = DataBlock(blocks=(ImageBlock(), CategoryBlock()), get_items=get_image_files, get_y=parent_label, splitter=RandomSplitter(valid_pct=0.2, seed=42), item_tfms=RandomResizedCrop(128, min_scale=0.75)) dls_MNIST = dblock_MNIST.dataloaders(path/(&#39;training&#39;), bs=8) . Let&#39;s take a look at these images to make sure the code is working as expected. As we can see, some of these images are not at the centre of the frame and this will help the model understand that the numbers don&#39;t need to be in the centre of the frame to be classified as a particular number. . dls_MNIST.show_batch(nrows=1, ncols=10) . learn_aug = cnn_learner(dls_MNIST, resnet18, pretrained=False, metrics=accuracy) learn_aug.fit_one_cycle(1, 0.1) . epoch train_loss valid_loss accuracy time . 0 | 0.213906 | 1398.733521 | 0.965500 | 03:47 | . prediction_results(learn_aug) . Actuals: [&#39;9&#39;, &#39;7&#39;, &#39;8&#39;, &#39;5&#39;, &#39;3&#39;, &#39;8&#39;, &#39;7&#39;, &#39;6&#39;, &#39;9&#39;, &#39;0&#39;] Predicted number: [&#39;9&#39;, &#39;9&#39;, &#39;9&#39;, &#39;9&#39;, &#39;9&#39;, &#39;5&#39;, &#39;3&#39;, &#39;3&#39;, &#39;3&#39;, &#39;3&#39;] Hit Rate: 10 % . Looks like that actually made things worse, the model was able to predict just predicted one digit correctly. However, I think we are moving in the right direction as the model is predicting numbers other than an 8 and 9. . Using the weights from a pre-trained model . Up until now we had used the fit_one_cycle to train the model. This method trains the model by calculating the weights of every layer of the neural network for the defined number of epochs. However, we can make use the weights of an already trained model to avoid re-learning the information based on just our dataset. For example, if we already have a model trained on a lot of diverse set of images we might be better off using that rather than fitting a model based on just our digits dataset. . One of the cool things fastai, is that it allows us to do this seamlessly. To do this, we select an already trained model like resnet18 and use the in-built freeze method to retains the weights of the pre-trained model for all but the last layer. Then by randomizing the weights of the last layer and then train the model using our MNIST dataset for one epoch. This will help us avoid reinventing the wheel and converge faster to the right solution. . The fine_tune method . fine_tune basically solves this problem for us with just one line of code. So fine_tune is a combination of fit_one_cycle and freeze using a discriminative learning rate that works quite well in most image datasets as we are leveraging on the pre-trained model. After calling unfreeze we use a lower learning rate to recalculate the weights of all the layers to avoid moving too far away from the current solution. . def fine_tune(self:Learner, epochs, base_lr=2e-3, freeze_epochs=1, lr_mult=100, pct_start=0.3, div=5.0, **kwargs): &quot;Fine tune with `freeze` for `freeze_epochs` then with `unfreeze` from `epochs` using discriminative LR&quot; self.freeze() self.fit_one_cycle(freeze_epochs, slice(base_lr), pct_start=0.99, **kwargs) base_lr /= 2 self.unfreeze() self.fit_one_cycle(epochs, slice(base_lr/lr_mult, base_lr), pct_start=pct_start, div=div, **kwargs) . learn_aug2 = cnn_learner(dls_MNIST, resnet18, metrics=accuracy) learn_aug2.fine_tune(2) . Downloading: &#34;https://download.pytorch.org/models/resnet18-5c106cde.pth&#34; to /root/.cache/torch/hub/checkpoints/resnet18-5c106cde.pth . . epoch train_loss valid_loss accuracy time . 0 | 0.350572 | 0.140770 | 0.955400 | 05:20 | . epoch train_loss valid_loss accuracy time . 0 | 0.132990 | 0.045039 | 0.987067 | 07:32 | . 1 | 0.084237 | 0.017081 | 0.995067 | 07:32 | . prediction_results(learn_aug2) . Actuals: [&#39;9&#39;, &#39;7&#39;, &#39;8&#39;, &#39;5&#39;, &#39;3&#39;, &#39;8&#39;, &#39;7&#39;, &#39;6&#39;, &#39;9&#39;, &#39;0&#39;] Predicted number: [&#39;9&#39;, &#39;1&#39;, &#39;8&#39;, &#39;5&#39;, &#39;3&#39;, &#39;8&#39;, &#39;1&#39;, &#39;6&#39;, &#39;9&#39;, &#39;8&#39;] Hit Rate: 70 % . Using the weights from the pre-trained model really helped improve the predictions in a short period of training time. Seems like the model has an issue predicting the 7s and the 0 at the end. This is probably caused by the fact that I tend to add a dash to the 7s and most of the training set does not. . Using a Deeper Network Architecture . An easier but more time-consuming fix is to use a more sophisticated pre-trained model. Let&#39;s see if using resnet50 instead of resnet18 helps us improve the prediction. This will consume more computing power and take longer but should help our prediction accuracy. . dblock_MNIST = DataBlock(blocks=(ImageBlock(), CategoryBlock()), get_items=get_image_files, get_y=parent_label, splitter=RandomSplitter(valid_pct=0.25, seed=42), item_tfms=RandomResizedCrop(128, min_scale=0.75)) dls_MNIST = dblock_MNIST.dataloaders(path/(&#39;training&#39;), bs=8) learn_resnet50 = cnn_learner(dls_MNIST, resnet50, metrics=accuracy).to_fp16() learn_resnet50.fine_tune(3) . epoch train_loss valid_loss accuracy time . 0 | 0.307046 | 0.099946 | 0.971533 | 05:57 | . epoch train_loss valid_loss accuracy time . 0 | 0.147680 | 0.041715 | 0.987400 | 07:33 | . 1 | 0.023815 | 0.029164 | 0.992333 | 07:37 | . 2 | 0.035072 | 0.018088 | 0.994933 | 07:43 | . prediction_results(learn_resnet50) . Actuals: [&#39;9&#39;, &#39;7&#39;, &#39;8&#39;, &#39;5&#39;, &#39;3&#39;, &#39;8&#39;, &#39;7&#39;, &#39;6&#39;, &#39;9&#39;, &#39;0&#39;] Predicted number: [&#39;9&#39;, &#39;2&#39;, &#39;8&#39;, &#39;5&#39;, &#39;3&#39;, &#39;8&#39;, &#39;7&#39;, &#39;6&#39;, &#39;9&#39;, &#39;0&#39;] Hit Rate: 90 % . Wow! That did great and solved most of our problems. It only misclassified the first 7 for 2 which is understandable because I add a dash to the 7s. .",

Every day gets more depressing than the last, bringing news of new cases and deaths to someone I know. It’s a really depressing environment and being locked up at home makes it so much worse. Watching COVID-19 rip up families and destroy the livelihood of nearly every other person was incredibly painful to watch. As news unfolded of even crematoriums being so over-worked that their steel chimneys were started to melt I got a sense of how bad the damage was. . With death being such a real possibility, I started to think about how I had lived my life and if it was my last day was to come in the near future how would I live these potential last few days. Would I want to spend them sitting around at home moping on about how helpless I felt? This was pretty much the same question that Steve Jobs contemplated upon and referred to in his Stanford commencement address. After rewatching that for the umpteenth time I decided to think about how I was spending my life and what regrets I would have if today was my last day. . My top regrets: . So the first thing that came to my mind was that I was not going to be able to visit all the places I wanted to. I still wanted to see, experience and accomplish so many things like going on a summit expedition, climbing my To-Do routes, Freediving, seeing Mt Everest, etc. Thinking of these made me feel privileged and the virtue-signalling part of me told me to stop. Also, these were impossible to do right now from home and all I could do to be in the best shape to do this was to stay healthy and workout from home. | So I narrowed my options into what would I regret not doing if I was indoors. If I was forced to stay locked down at home and if today was my last day, what would I do? The first thing that came to mind was to finish the fastai course I had started a few weeks back. I was looking to learn about building Neural Networks and Deep Learning and try to build applications that would supplement my life as a derivatives trader.

            "title": "Recurrent Neural Networks",
            "content": "Objective: . Traditional Neural networks found it very difficult to execute tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP). To understand a sentence it is important to both understand each word, it&#39;s relationship with the previous and successive words and also the context in which the word is being used. Recurrent Neural Networks adopt a structure that helps solve this issue and is the main focus of this article. I will then explore approaches and try to build a text generator . Language Model: . Language Modelling is a central task in Natural Language Processing and is at the heart of many systems like speech recognition, machine translation and text generation. Given the words $ x_{1},..., x_{t}$ the language model predicts the following probability . $$ P(x_{t+1} = v_{j} | x_{t}, ... x_{1}) $$where $v_{j}$ is every word in the vocabulary. Here I will be building a Language Model using Recurrent Neural Networks. . What is a Recurrent Neural Network? . A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a type of Neural Network that allows previous outputs to be used as inputs while using hidden states. It is called a Recurrent Network because it repeatedly takes an input, uses it to modify a hidden layer and then provides an output which is then fed back to the hidden layer along with the next input. The hidden layer acts as &quot;memory&quot; that keeps track of the previous inputs by how the weights in the layer were modified by the said input. Consider an example of a RNN working on predicting the next word in a sentence. The first word is passed into a hidden layer, the output of this hidden layer is then passed on to the next hidden layer along with the second word. This process continues till all the inputs are passed on to the final output layer which predicts the final word. In this way, the RNN has an &quot;understanding&quot; of each word in the network and can make a reasonable prediction of the final word. . # TODO: Add image of RNN for predicting the next word here:: . The structure used here is a many-to-one type of RNN. Many other RNN architectures have been developed to accomplish other tasks like music generation, sentiment analysis and machine translation. . import pandas as pd . | Advantages | Disadvantages | | Can Process inputs of any length | Slow Computation | . | Model size does not increase with size of input | Difficulty accessing information passed a long time ago | . | Computation takes into account historical information | | | Weights are shared across time | | . Long Short Term Memory (LSTM): . One of the main drawbacks in using RNNs is that of Vanishing or Exploding Gradients. This is what While training the data with so many layers will result in gradients of the layers to explore to a very large number or diminsh to a number close to 0. This problem was exacerbated as the length of the input sequence increased and were not very useful in making predictions as the sentences got very long. . To avoid this a special type iof RNN using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) units were developed. When we say LSTM NEtwork, we mean a neural network which contains an LSTM recurrent layer. LSTM cells were first introduced in 1997 in a paper by Sepp Hochreiter and Jürgen Schmidhuber. In the paper, the authors describe how LSTMs do not suffer from the same vanishing gradient problem experienced by RNNs and can be trained on sequences that are hundreds of timesteps long. Since then, the LSTM architecture has been adapted and improved, and variations such as gated recurrent units (GRUs) are now widely utilized and available as layers in Keras. . Let&#39;s build a simple LSTM network in Keras here: . Tokenization . The first step to handling text data is to tokenize the text, Tokenization is the process of splitting the text into individual parts like words or characters. First we get the text we would like to tokenize, I am choosing to use The Strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by R.L Stevenson, one of my favourite books form middle school.

Otherwise it &#39;s not silent, now is it? n&gt; n&gt;&gt;&gt;Non-religious reasons for having a &#34;moment of silence&#34; for a dead n&gt;&gt;&gt;classmate: (1) to comfort the friends by showing respect to the n&gt;&gt;&gt;deceased , (2) to give the classmates a moment to grieve together, (3) n&gt;&gt;&gt;to give the friends a moment to remember their classmate *in the n&gt;&gt;&gt;context of the school*, (4) to deal with the fact that the classmate n&gt;&gt;&gt;is gone so that it &#39;s not disruptive later. n&gt; n&gt;&gt;Yeah, all well and good. The fact is, though, that the pro-school n&gt;&gt;prayer types have tried to use a moment of silence as a way n&gt;&gt;to get prayer back. At my high school for instance, our dear n&gt;&gt;principal ended the moment of silence with &#34;Amen.&#34; n&gt;I can certainly see opposing the &#34;Amen&#34; -- but that doesn &#39;t require n&gt;opposing a moment of silence. nI see it as the camel &#39;s nose. n n&gt;&gt;I &#39;ll back off when they do. n&gt;Does anybody else besides me see a vicious circle here? I guarantee n&gt;you the people who want school prayer aren &#39;t going to back off when n&gt;they can &#39;t even manage to get a quiet moment for their kids to pray n&gt;silently. nI &#39;m willing to take my chances on winning the whole thing, personally. n-Ekr n n n-- nEric Rescorla ekr@eitech.com n &#34;What we &#39;ve got here is failure to communicate.&#34; n n&#39; .

USing Loss Function Change: This methodology meaures how much the loss function cahnges based on the fetaure changes. In this porcess we are training the model with the feature and then train the modle without the feature (This second precess is approximated by using we atre removing thsi feature from all the tress and avaraging the leaf values ad then saying that this would be the effect of dropping this feature from the prediction) This loss function change works well but is time-consuming. These feature importances is both positiove and negative and I will remove the features that affect the loss function negatively. . model_prev.get_feature_importance(train_pool, &#39;LossFunctionChange&#39;, prettified=True) .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 .
